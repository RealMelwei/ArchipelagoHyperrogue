# Hyperrogue

## What does randomization do to this game?

Checks are rewarded (depending on the settings) for satisfying the unlock conditions of lands, and for obtaining 10, 25, and 50 treasures in each land (or 1, 3, 8 for Camelot).

When other players find checks for you, these are handled as progressive checks for each land: The first time you receive a given land, it is unlocked, the second time its orb becomes available in crossroads and the land itself, and the third time the orb becomes available globally.

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure
and export a config file.
